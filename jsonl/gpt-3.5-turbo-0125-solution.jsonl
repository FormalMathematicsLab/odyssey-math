{"Problem_86": "To find the maximum value of the real number $c$, we need to analyze the given conditions and constraints carefully. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Problem Analysis:\n1. We are given a set of positive integers $a_i$ and positive even numbers $b_i$ that satisfy certain conditions.\n2. The condition specifies that for any positive integers $i_1$ and $i_2$ where $1 \\leq i_1 < i_2 \\leq n$, $a_{i_1} \\neq a_{i_2}$ and $b_{i_1} \\neq b_{i_2}$ at least one holds true.\n3. We need to determine the maximum value of the real number $c$ such that $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\geq c$ for all positive integers $n$ and all valid $a_i$ and $b_i$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. Let's consider the sum of all $b_i$ values: $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}$.\n2. We know that each $b_i$ is a positive even number, so the sum of even numbers will be an even number.\n3. We can rewrite the inequality as $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\geq c$.\n4. To simplify the expression, we can rewrite it as $\\frac{2k}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\geq c$, where $k$ is an integer.\n5. Rearranging the inequality, we get $k \\geq c \\cdot n^{\\frac{3}{2}} / 2$.\n6. Since $k$ is an integer, the maximum value of $c$ will be the maximum value of $c \\cdot n^{\\frac{3}{2}} / 2$ for all positive integers $n$.\n\n### Theoretical Justification:\n- The condition that $a_{i_1} \\neq a_{i_2}$ and $b_{i_1} \\neq b_{i_2}$ ensures that each pair of $a_i$ and $b_i$ is distinct, preventing repetitions.\n- The inequality $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\geq c$ is a measure of the average value of $b_i$ relative to $n^{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\n\n### Calculation Verification:\nLet's calculate the maximum value of $c$ by considering the extreme case where $n=1$:\n- For $n=1$, the maximum value of $c$ will be $c = k/2$.\n- Since $k$ is an integer, the maximum value of $c$ will be the maximum integer value of $k/2$.\n\n### Conclusive Summary:\nThe maximum value of the real number $c$ can be found by considering the extreme case when $n=1$ and determining the maximum integer value of $k/2$. This approach ensures that the inequality holds for all positive integers $n$ and all valid $a_i$ and $b_i$. \n\nNow, let's calculate the maximum value of $c$ in the given scenario."}
